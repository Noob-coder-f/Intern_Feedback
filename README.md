# Intern_Feedback

## About  
Intern_Feedback is a web application built to gather, process and display feedback from interns — making feedback collection structured, streamlined and easy to analyse.

## Features  
- Intuitive front-end UI (built with React / plain JS) for interns to submit their feedback.  
- Backend API to store feedback responses in a database.  
- Admin dashboard for viewing, filtering and exporting feedback.  
- Secure endpoints and validation to ensure quality of data.  
- Role-based access: Interns → Submit feedback; Admins → View & manage responses.

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: React (or JavaScript / HTML / CSS) located in the `Frontend` folder.  
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express (or similar) in the `Backend` folder.  
- **Database**: MongoDB / MySQL / PostgreSQL (whichever you prefer).  
- **Version control**: Git & GitHub.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js (v14 or newer)  
- npm or yarn  
- Database server (MongoDB / MySQL / PostgreSQL) running  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Noob-coder-f/Intern_Feedback.git  
   cd Intern_Feedback  
Setup backend

bash
Copy code
cd Backend  
npm install  
# configure database credentials in .env file  
npm run dev  # or npm start  
Setup frontend

bash
Copy code
cd ../Frontend  
npm install  
npm start  
Open your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or the port you configured) and you should see the app.

Copy code
DB_HOST=your_database_host  
DB_USER=your_database_user  
DB_PASS=your_database_password

Usage
Interns submit feedback via the form — name, department, internship duration, feedback text, rating, etc.

Admins log in to view feedback responses, filter by department, rating, date range, export to CSV/Excel.
